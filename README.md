# First Project

Hello World! Thanks for stopping by my first project repository. My name is Don McQueen and I am a Cloud professional on a journey to learn how to code, specifically in Python. You will find a group of files that are my practice exercises to learn Python. I have a lot of goals to accomplish as a professional, and learning how to code will help me get there.

## Connect with me outside of GitHub

Feel free to reach out to me on discord 'Donnie#2684' if you want to chat and learn more about Cloud or other technologies. 

Also, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-mcqueen/ if you like networking on that platform too!

Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!
